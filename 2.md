## Terraform

- Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.
- Consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. 
- Manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
- Creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs).

Presenter notes:
- Such as Disaster recovery, Developement, User Application Testing, Staging and Production Environments
- As we redeploy new sites for our growing Organizations we can also use terraform to provision identical workflows in other regions.
- Computer, Storage and high level services
- Create modules for each Terraform environment for all service categories based on the cloud of choice to organize your codification
